@10001	= ~Emily's Tale

I have accepted the service of a noble archer named Emily within my group. She has joined me in hopes of venturing to Baldur's gate to find her birth mother. Perhaps we may find her there.~

@10002 = ~Emily's Tale

Emily suggests we ask around the the Blade and Stars for her mother's whereabouts. It appears she is really uncertain where she may even be within the city.~

@10003 = ~Emily's Tale

Emily discovered the elf we killed was her mother. She was angry and left our party..~

@10004 = ~Emily's Tale

Emily discovered the elf we killed was her mother. She is angry, but remains with us.~

@10005 = ~Emily's Tale

Apparently the elf we aided was Emily's mother. She gave Emily a journal explaining many details of her absence and story to her, including her Aasimar heritage.~

The Innkeeper of the Blade and Stars suggested we try looking at the inn southeast of here, as his own did not have many elven patrons.~

@100045 = ~The Planar Hunters~ 

@100046 = ~The Planar Hunters

Some Planar Hunters are hunting an elf within the city. They've asked for our aid, but I turned them down.~

@100047 = ~The Planar Hunters

Some Planar Hunters are hunting an elf within the city. They've asked for our aid, and given us a gem that will reveal her, though we only have one, and should be certain.~

@100048 = ~The Planar Hunters 

We used a gem on an elf we believed to be our target, and it seemed to reveal both the elf and Emily. The gem could be faulty, or perhaps Emily may be planar-touched herself.~

@100049 = ~The Planar Hunters 

We betrayed Emily to the Planar Hunters, and accepted our reward.~

@100050 = ~The Planar Hunters 

We killed the elf and accepted our reward.~

@100051 = ~The Planar Hunters 

We killed the Planar Hunters. We should tell the elf of our success.~

@100052 = ~The Planar Hunters 

The elf gave us our gratitude, and Emily a strange book written in celestial. Perhaps she is connected to Emily somehow, though only the book will reveal it once Emily reads through it.~

@100053 = ~The Planar Hunters 

We have killed the elf. We should inform the Planar Hunters.~

@100054 = ~The Planar Hunters 

An elf has asked for our help in taking down planar hunters that seem to be going after her. They should be in Baldur's Gate Southeast section.~

@101 = ~The Planar Hunters 

We have come across some planar hunters hunting Caelar. They gave us a blade for revealing we helped give them another plane touched to them back in Baldur's Gate.~

@102 = ~Recruitment Drive

The Aasimar Emily has joined my party. She reveals she was traveling with a second aasimar named Jacob, but they got split up when they diverged paths to shake off Planar Hunters that were tracking them.~

@103 = ~The Aasimar~

@104 = ~The Aasimar 

We met Emily's former companion, Jacob. He's agreed to talk to us privately. I could attempt to get information from him, or get him to leave the crusade.~

@105 = ~The Aasimar 

Jacob refused to join us. We couldn't risk him revealing us, and attacked.~

@106 = ~The Aasimar 

We couldn't persuade Jacob to take our cause. We can only hope he is not one of the people we have to kill in battle.~

@107 = ~The Aasimar 

We managed to convince Jacob to leave the crusade.~

@50 = ~The Dead Shot +2, Enhanced~
@51 = ~Longbow of Marksmanship: The Dead Shot
Driven by years of rivalry, the dukes of Spandeliyon and Delthuntle decided to organize a private contest that would proclaim the better archer between them. Both boasted the power of their magical bows, but that wasn't enough for Edwall Dest, Duke of Spandeliyon. He arranged for the theft of his opponent's bow, and on the day of the contest, he couldn't help gloat in his advantage. The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed. Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself. The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment, Edwall's head did much the same.

A short-lived outpost of humans in the Frozen Forest unearthed this weapon, and many others, from the ruins of an ancient settlement deep within that cold land. Never knowing the names of their extinct benefactors, the colonists used these "tools" to carve a large territory for themselves, though in the end it was for naught. Crushed by a superior number of hobgoblins, these unfortunate souls have joined the ancients in their anonymity.

In order to protect their community from an encroaching orc logging encampment, the hero Hannable the White was given this magnificent bow by the dryads of Gulthmere Forest. A deadly confrontation followed when the loggers dared to try to cut down a great oak tree, nearly killing the dryad linked to it. With the help of powerful forest animals, Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood. The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest. Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily... nay, VERY happily ever after!

One night at camp Kitsana's party each took a turn trying to master the unusually thin bowstring and uniquely curved grip of the weapon. None shot as poorly as the fighter, a braggart named Tirrel, who not only missed his target by a foot but who snapped the bowstring down the length of his forearm and tore off a strip of skin. Kitsana and her party faded into obscurity decades ago but her bow still circulates.
